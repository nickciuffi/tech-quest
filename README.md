# tech-quest

This is a project to practice my **Next.js**, **Typescript** and **Node.js** abilities. <br>
This project has three parts: <br>
1. The front-end, which you can see in this repository;
2. the back-end: https://github.com/nickciuffi/tech-quest-api;
3. The admin front-end: https://github.com/nickciuffi/tech-quest-admin;

# Tech stack:

For the front-end I used Next.js to create static pages and get a faster rendered website.
It was also used figma for the design and SASS for styling.

# Conclusion

Although this is the main part of the project, it was actually the easiest one to create, because it is just a consumer of a very complex group of data.
